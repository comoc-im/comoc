# Comoc IM

> This project is still in early development. Use at your own risk.

## Why another IM?

  There sure are lots of popular IMs around, many of them are rather good. But most of them are provided by big
Coops, which leads to users unable to fully control their own chat messages. Comoc IM tends to be the one puts
user control first.

  Comoc IM will achieve this by default end-to-end encryption, a p2p-like decentralized service network, 
and many more nice solid ideas from open source community.

  A chat client is used to send and accept messages. A comoc signaling server(named `beacon`) will only transfer those
messages. All beacon server together form the decentralized service network. A chat client and a beacon server combined 
is a Comoc node.

  Put simply, everyone can run a Comoc node to communicate with one another.
